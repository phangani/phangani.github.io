            <h1>Why Minankari is unique?</h1>
            <p id="s-p">According to archaeological excavations the first hominids in Europe (1.8 million years ago) is found in Georgia. The country is at the crossroads of Europe and Asia though Georgian culture has preserved its traditions and original style. Georgia is considered the birthplace of winemaking. After a thorough examination of some 5 500 years jars unearthed in Georgia, archeologists have declared that the artifacts contain the world’s oldest honey. From the 11th to the 13th century, Georgia experienced its “Golden Age of cultural, political and military ascendancy”. The reign of Queen Tamar represented the peak of Georgia's might in the whole history of the nation.
              Georgia is famous for its art of color and boundless energy. For many centuries it was amazing symbiosis of Georgian, European and Oriental influences. At the XIX century was the recovery and development of Georgian culture with the recreation of unique technology of the past and developing new. This happened with the famous jewelry – Georgian cloisonne enamel “Minankari”. This jewelry of amazing beauty hits with incredible subtlety of color solutions. Besides, the method itself remains unchanged for twelve centuries. And its cost is not less than jewelry made of precious metals and stones. Cloisonne – labor-intensive and complicated technique of enameling, not amenable to mechanization.

        <p id="s-p">Most of the existing monuments of cloisonne dated eighth to twelfth century, but despite such a venerable age, they didn’t loose their charm. Thanks to its incredibly high artistic value, Georgian cloisonne takes its rightful place among the world’s treasures. According to the researchers, the Georgian cloisonne – a worthy competitor to the Pala d’Oro, the golden altarpiece in the Basilica of St. Mark (Venice). in fact, enamel is thin glassy coating, obtained by melting the glass powders of different metals with impurities which gives different colors to the product itself. One of the reasons why foreign tourists arrive in Georgia – a unique, very original jewelry of the highest quality, sold at a low price.</p>
