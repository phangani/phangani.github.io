        <img src="./img/Funicular.jpg" alt="photo>">

       </ul>
       <h2>What You Can Expect</h2>
         <p>Mtatsminda is the mountain topped by the 300 m-high TV mast that overlooks central Tbilisi. Located 800-metres above the city Mtatsminda Park (known as Bombora) spreads over more than 1 sq. km and has been a popular fun spot for generations. The Tbilisi Funicular is also a mountainous cable-operated railroad with upper and lower stations. High above Tbilisi you will find the most stylish center for food and drink in the city: the Funicular Restaurant Complex. Without doubt, the Funicular Complex is one of the most important places in Tbilisi, with its significant long history dating back to 1905. A French botanist, Emil Levie wrote this about Tbilisi: "In the evenings, the city is a wonderful sight from the top. I feel as if I am looking at Paris from the top of the Eiffel Tower". Why not? Perhaps sometime in the future someone else will write something similar.</p>
         <p>The meeting point is at the entrance of cable train on Chonkadze street in front of the small park named - Vilnius Square. Your tour guide will meet you there at 5 PM. After boarding on the train you will be taken on Mtatsminda Mountain. Cable train climbs at 55° for five minutes to reach its upper terminal, at an altitude of 727m on the edge of “Mtatsminda”, (the Holy Mountain), so called because of St David's Cave.  From the train you can enjoy with the spectacular panoramic views of whole Tbilisi. With a brand new Funicular train going from Chonkadze Street, you can take a magnificent trip to the Funicular Complex. After climbing on the top of mountain we will have a little walk in the Mtatsminda amusement park. This park on the top of Mtatsminda Mountain offers extreme zone with a roller coaster for adrenaline addicts as well as family and kids zones. There are video games, karting for kids, water slides and many other attractions. A ride on the biggest Ferris Wheel, perched on the edge of the hill provides one of the best views over Tbilisi and to the Caucasus Mountains in the distance. After walking in the park take a dinner break in the most famous restaurant of Tbilisi “The Funicular restaurant complex” with tasty Georgian dishes like Khinkali and Khachapuri with the famous Georgian red Wine. Enjoy dinner with stunning panoramic views over Tbilisi. It's also usually several degrees cooler up here than in the city below, which can be very welcome in the heat of summer.  After the dinner is over we come back by cable train and once more you can enjoy with the magnificent view of night Tbilisi.</p>
